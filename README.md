## Features

- **Real-time Internet Speed Test**: The app measures and displays the download speed of your internet connection in MB/s.
- **Interactive Gauge Interface**: The speed test results are shown on a dynamic gauge that changes color based on speed.
- **Latency Measurement**: The app also calculates and displays the latency (ping) of your connection.
- **AdMob Native Ads Integration**: Monetize the app with native ads that blend seamlessly with the app's UI.

## Installation

To run this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samyak2403/internet-speed-tester.git


# Internet Speed Test App

This Android application measures internet speed and displays the results in a visually engaging way, along with displaying native ads for monetization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed.
- Install all required dependencies as prompted by Android Studio.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Replace the placeholder `YOUR_ADMOB_NATIVE_AD_UNIT_ID` in the `AdUtils.kt` file with your actual AdMob Native Ad Unit ID.

### Running the App

1. Build and run the project on an Android device or emulator.

## How It Works

- The app uses the `SpeedTestSocket` library to perform internet speed tests by downloading a file and measuring the transfer rate.
- The results are displayed on a graphical gauge that is color-coded to indicate different speed ranges.
- A native ad is displayed below the speed test results to generate revenue.

## Key Components

- **MainActivity**: The core activity that handles the speed test process and UI updates.
- **Gauge Interface**: Displays the download speed in a visually engaging way.
- **AdUtils**: A utility class that stores AdMob unit IDs and manages ad loading.
